- Enable **runtime prefetching** of personalized content by including it in prefetch requests.
- Use `use cache: private` when you need to cache **user-specific data** that depends on cookies, headers, or search params.
- Unlike regular `use cache`, private caches can access request-specific APIs like `cookies()` and `headers()` directly inside the cached function.
- Private caches are **never persisted** to cache handlers - they're only used to mark the dynamic content as runtime prefetchable.
- Without `use cache: private`, personalized content cannot be prefetched and must wait until navigation occurs.

# !!col

```tsx app/private-cache/product/[id]/with-private/page.tsx
async function getRecommendations(productId: string) {
  // !mark
  'use cache: private';
  cacheTag(`recommendations-${productId}`);
  cacheLife({ stale: 60 });

  // Can call cookies() INSIDE the cached function!
  // !mark
  const sessionId = (await cookies()).get('session-id')?.value || 'guest';

  return getPersonalizedRecommendations(productId, sessionId);
}

async function Recommendations({ productId }: { productId: string }) {
  // This will be runtime prefetched automatically
  const recommendations = await getRecommendations(productId);

  return (
    <div>
      {recommendations.map((rec) => (
        <ProductCard key={rec.id} product={rec} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export const unstable_prefetch = {
  mode: 'runtime',
  samples: [
    { params: { id: '1' }, cookies: [{ name: 'session-id', value: '1' }] },
  ],
};
```

### Demo

- Products labeled **"Private Cache"** link to pages that use `use cache: private` to enable runtime prefetching. The content is still dynamic, but it's prefetched
  when the static content of the page is also prefetched.
- Products labeled **"No Private Cache"** link to pages that don't use `use cache: private`, meaning their recommendations will be loaded after navigation.
- **For demo purposes**, the links display visual loading states:
  - **Pink border** with "Prefetching Private Cache..." when the runtime prefetch is in progress
  - **Blue border** with "Prefetched Private Cache" when the runtime prefetch has completed
  - **Gray border** for links without private cache
- **With Private Cache**: Personalized recommendations appear instantly (runtime prefetched).
- **Without Private Cache**: Recommendations show a loading skeleton, then appear after they're finished loading. The loading starts when the link is clicked.
- Click "Change Session" to get different personalized recommendations - notice how Private Cache links still runtime prefetch your new session's data.

### Notes

- This demo uses the experimental `use cache` directive and describes caching behavior once stable.
- `use cache: private` enables runtime prefetching of dynamic content by allowing `cookies()` and `headers()` inside cached functions.
- Requires `unstable_prefetch` export with `mode: 'runtime'` and `cacheLife({ stale: 60 })` (â‰¥30s).
